* EMACS

** Getting emacs
: sudo apt-get install emacs
I suggest doing the tutorial to be able to use some of emacs basic functionnalities.

** Emacs config file
*** Where ?
: ~/.emacs
*** Emacs load
In .emacs, everything before ~(require 'org)~ is loaded before org
*** A good archive for packages
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
#+END_EXAMPLE
Just put those lines in .emacs file before org is loaded. ( ~(require 'org)~ )

** Customize emacs
*** Change theme
~Options~ -> ~Customize Emacs~ -> ~Custom Themes~

*** Select packages
: Alt+x list-packages
Or ~Options~ -> ~Manage Emacs Packages~

*** Recommanded packages
**** For org
+ org
+ toc-org (to make a table of content)

*** Recommended options
You can activate options with the command, but then you have to save them for next sessions : ~Options~ -> ~Customize Emacs~ -> ~Saved Options~ and change State to Save for future sessions. Don't forget to apply and save before quitting.
Don't forget when you are typing something, you can tab to show possible completions or autocomplete.
**** Insert over selected text
: M-x delete-selection-mode
**** Show parenthesis matching
: M-x show-paren-mode


** Basic and default keybindings
*** CTRL and ALT
In emacs, commands are often used with CONTROL (ctrl) or META (alt). When you find a keybinding, it's usually written like this : ~C-w~ or ~M-x~.
It means you have to maintain ctrl or alt pressed and hit the other key. When you see something like C-x C-f, it's the same but in two times. You can keep the ctrl button pressed while hitting x then f, or not, either way is ok.

*** Cut/Copy/Paste
: C-w / M-w / M-y

*** Undo 
: C-x u
Don't keep the ctrl button pressed while hitting u.


*** Case conversion
+ Convert the following word to lower case
: M-l
+ Convert the following word to upper case
: M-u
+ Put the first letter of the following word into upper case and the rest into lower case
: M-c

** Divide a buffer
*** Vertically 
: C-x (maj)3
*** Horizontally
: C-x (maj)2
*** Go back to only one window
: C-x (maj)1

** Change windows' size without the mouse
*** Increase height
: C-x (alt gr)^
*** Increase width
: C-x (alt gr)}
*** Decrease width
: C-x (alt gr){
*** Make all windows same height/width
: C-x +
